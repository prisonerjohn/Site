An iPad app allowing you to explore fractions by creating hilarious and dazzling photo mashups.

Mashing up images is engaging and fun. With Fraction Mash, you directly manipulate the fractions that control the way the pictures are partitioned. Attend closely to the fractions themselves and develop a deep intuitive understanding of fractions. App features include using photos from the library or camera, multiple grid options (squares, rows, columns, pie slices, triangles, etc.), overlays, photo blending, and sharing of images to social networks and NYSCI gallery.

Fraction Mash is part of [Noticing Tools](http://noticing.nysci.org/), a suite of iPad apps that make learning math and science irresistible through play, creative design projects, and collaboration.
