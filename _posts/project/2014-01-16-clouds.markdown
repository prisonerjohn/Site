####CLOUDS

An interactive documentary exploring the community of digital artists and hackers creating tools for poetic, socially engaged experiments in technology.

Rather than limiting the documentary to a fixed narrative, all the scenes and interview snippets exist in a database of tagged content. The viewer can navigate a cloud of ideas and trace a path through the network by asking the system questions, or sit back and watch as the StoryEngine takes over and generates sequences on the ï¬‚y.

There are currently two versions of the documentary. The first is targeted for small groups, consisting of a main display for the interviews and visual systems, and a secondary display for metadata and a map of the information network. Users select questions and interact with systems using their hands, which are tracked by a [Kinect](https://dev.windows.com/en-us/kinect) sensor. The second version is for individual viewing, using the Oculus Rift headset to immerse the user into the film.

CLOUDS premiered at [Sundance New Frontier 2014](https://www.sundance.org/festival/festival-program/new-frontier/).
